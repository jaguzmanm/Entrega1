            <p class="col-sm-12 col-md-8">Hello, my name is John Alexander Guzmán. I am a systems and computing
              engineering student in Universidad de los Andes and I am also doing a double
              program with electronic engineering. I am the youngest of two siblings in my
              family, my oldest sister is a lawyer graduated from Universidad de los Andes
              and works with Alcaldia de Bogotá. My older brother is a professional
              photographer graduated from Taller 5.</p>

              <h3>Automatic Detection of Points</h3>
              <p>During the robotics course from the IELE department, I worked along with some classmates in an
                application to automatically detect coordinates of certain points of a live streaming from a camera.
                This application is particularly useful when programming a robot because it allows the robot to position
                himself in the environment.</p>

              <h3>GUI to control a Rover</h3>
              <p>I was a member in the student group RoboCol, in there I worked with the interface group, the purpose of
                the group was to make a website that connects with all the information from ROS topics given by the
                rover hardware, process this information and present it to the user. In the other hand, the
                communication was bidirectional, in the way that you could also control the rover using the GUI designed
                for that purpose.</p>

            <p>I am very interested in learning about robotics and artificial intelligence, particularly, what interests
              me the most is machine learning techniques and all the possibilities that those algorithms have to offer
              to solve complex problems. In the other hand, I also like everything related to backend development.</p>
            <p>My main hobbies are playing basketball, playing videogames and to watch series, but I also like spending
              time with friends, going to parties and playing with my pets, which I have 7 in my house by the way.</p>
            <p>During my career, I have developed many abilities related to programing. I have some basics in frontend
              development, and some more knowledge in the backend side of applications. I have worked with some of the
              most popular frameworks like angular and Django.</p>

              <p>I studied my entire school years in the Colegio Montemorel, from first grade until graduation. After
                graduating from school in 2016, I took a year to learn english, so I went to England to an academy to
                study
                the language. In 2018, I started studying electronic engineering at Universidad de los Andes and started
                a
                double program with systems and computing engineering until today.</p>

              <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
              <p>Regardless to my professional experience, I have worked as a technician at my parents’ company, doing
                some
                maintenance on slots machines. I have been a teacher assistant in many programming courses during my
                career.
                In order to practice everything I have learnt during my career, I joined the students group RoboCol,
                where I
                worked as a web developer to connect all information from the rover into a website.</p>
